Rita Braxton, an employee in Dining Services, passed away on March 16, 2015.

Braxton was born in Akron, Ohio, and moved to Pomona in 1962, where she attended Garey High School. She began her work career at Sunkist in Ontario when she was 17 then worked at General Electric for 12 years. She transitioned to a new career as a cook, obtaining extensive food service and preparation experience, which she utilized at Cal Poly Pomona, Pomona Unified School District and Heritage Park Adult Living in Alta Loma.

She joined Harvey Mudd as a cook in 2008 and quickly became a dear friend and colleague. Many who had breakfast or lunch in Hoch-Shanahan Dining Commons were most likely served by Braxton, who was known for greeting her customers warmly and with a smile.

Braxton is survived by two daughters, Karen Gray of Texas and LaTricia Braxton of Pomona, California—a son, Harold Jr., preceded her in death—three grandchildren, one great-grandson and many other family and friends, including her extended family at Harvey Mudd College.
