Richard “Dick” Chrystie ’61, a beloved member of the Founding Class, died Oct. 18. Dick attended Harvey Mudd College then transferred and ultimately graduated in 1962 with a bachelor’s in physics and chemistry from California State Polytechnic University, Pomona.

While working as an engineer for General Dynamics in Pomona, he also owned a sailboat that he raced regularly. He was West Coast High Point in Finn for 1965 and made it through eliminations to the North American Single-hand Finals (O-day Finals) in Seattle that same year. He went on to work for Ford Aeronutronics (where he met his wife, Sandi), then for Hughes Aircraft (29 years), where he was head of the Secure Projects Section of the Mechanical Design Department and was a member of the senior staff.

After retiring from Hughes, Dick and Sandi moved to their cabin in Big Bear where he became general manager at Ollila Industries. They moved to Hesperia when Sandi became ill with emphysema; she passed away in 2005. Dick was an avid builder of models and model airplanes and was a member and treasurer of his local Radio Control flying club. He taught model flying, was a private pilot, enjoyed fishing on his boat and traveling in his RV. Dick is survived by his daughter, Brenda Chrystie.
