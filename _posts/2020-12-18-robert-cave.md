The Harvey Mudd College community mourns the loss of respected chemist, distinguished teacher and widely recognized scholar Robert J. Cave who died Dec. 18. Known for his hearty laugh and his welcoming and congenial manner, Cave served on the Harvey Mudd faculty for 32 years.

Robert J. Cave was born in Brooklyn, N.Y., and was raised on the east coast, “traveling west” (to his way of thinking at the time) when he attended Michigan State University. He received a B.Sc. in chemical physics from Michigan State and then really moved west, attending Caltech on a National Science Foundation Fellowship in chemistry, receiving his PhD in 1986.
