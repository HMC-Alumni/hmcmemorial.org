Nancy Gamer, a Harvey Mudd College Honorary Alumna and former director of alumni relations, passed away on April 26. She was 80 years old.

Gamer arrived at Harvey Mudd in 1977 as a temporary worker and then was hired as alumni secretary. She was promoted into fundraising then to director of alumni relations. At HMC she determinedly advocated for those who worked for her; her kitchen for many years was a kind of social and professional hub. During her 11-year tenure, the annual fund increased 1,000 percent. On her retirement, her position was divided into three, a testimony to her drive and abilities, and the HMC Alumni Association Board of Governors named her an Honorary Alumna. Even 25 years later, she is still remembered for the pivotal role she played as the College came into its own.

On leaving HMC, she went back to her passion and vocation, teaching writing at Claremont McKenna College’s Writing Center. Students, especially those writing theses, regularly sought out “that lady … the one who knew all the rules” for more than 15 years. She retired in 2007, eventually moving to Portland in 2015 to be near her son, Jeff. She is survived by her sons, Michael and Jeff, and by her two brothers, John and Norman.
