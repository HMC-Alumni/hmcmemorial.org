Jean Ferguson Platt, founding first lady of Harvey Mudd College, passed away on Feb. 18 in Claremont, Calif. She was 91.

Jean Platt, wife of Founding President and physics Professor Joseph Beaven Platt, was deeply involved in the founding of HMC, helping to establish the College in the 1950s and supporting its mission in the decades that followed. After leaving HMC in 1976, Joe and Jean Platt devoted five years to Claremont Graduate University as president and first lady.

Jean Platt was preceded in death by Joe, who died July 10, 2012. They are survived by two daughters, Ann Platt Walker of La Jolla, Calif., and Elizabeth Platt Garrow of Willowbrook, Ill.; their husbands, Richard Walker and Thomas Garrow; grandchildren Stephen Cavell Walker, Jay Bradbury Walker, Jennifer Elizabeth Garrow and Erin Alexander Garrow; and five great-grandchildren.

“Jean’s love of HMC was an integral part of the College’s early years, especially in the development of our students and alumni,” said HMC President Maria Klawe. “During her 20 years as HMC’s first lady, she opened her home to host first-year dinners, arranged faculty teas and stood by Joe’s side through the building of the College. In addition to her contributions to HMC, Jean was an energetic and faithful community volunteer. I am so thankful to Jean for all that she has done for Harvey Mudd College and the community at large.”
