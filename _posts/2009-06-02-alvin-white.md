Professor of Mathematics Emeritus Alvin White, a long-time member of the Department of Mathematics at Harvey Mudd College (HMC), died June 2, 2009.

"Alvin served the college from 1962 until his retirement in 1996 with grace, kindness and good humor," said Vice President and Dean of Faculty [Robert Cave](/2020-12-18/robert-cave.html) in an announcement to the college community. "He loved mathematics and was a strong advocate within and beyond HMC for seeing mathematics as a humanistic discipline. He was also a friendly and supportive senior colleague to young faculty."

Professor of Mathematics Emeritus [Robert Borrelli](/2013-09-11/bob-borrelli.html) said of his colleague, "Al was the sweetest, kindest person who was very interested in helping students. He will be missed."

Before coming to HMC, White was a member of the Math Research Center at the University of Wisconsin. He earned his A.B. in liberal arts at Columbia University, his M.A. in mathematics at UCLA and his Ph.D. in mathematics at Stanford University.

White served for many years as project director for the Interdisciplinary Holistic Teaching/Learning Program at The Claremont Colleges, which advocated a synthesis of science and humanities and an awareness of the interdependence of intuitive and analytical thought processes. In 1971, he was called upon to take part in the State of California's Blue Ribbon Commission on Writing Standards.

In addition to his teaching and research at HMC, White was the founding editor of Humanistic Mathematics Network Journal, which was part of a resurgence in the recognition of mathematics as a humanistic discipline. The journal was funded largely through grants from the Exxon Education Foundation.
