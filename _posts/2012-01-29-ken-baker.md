D. Kenneth Baker, Harvey Mudd College's second president, passed away on Sunday, Jan. 29, at his home in Ithaca, NY. He was 88.

Baker became the second president of Harvey Mudd College in 1976 following Founding President Joseph B. Platt, who served for two decades. During his 12 years at the helm, Baker was instrumental in increasing the College's enrollment, facilities and prestige, and guiding the College as technical innovations and social changes occurred. He oversaw the acquisition of land and property to meet major campus needs, which included upgraded laboratories and construction of additional housing (Atwood and Case residence halls), allowing all students to be housed on campus at the time.

Additional accomplishments that occurred during Baker's tenure included work to establish the Biology and Computer Science departments, the computer "wiring" of the HMC campus (the first college campus in California to be completely wired), the naming of the Department of Chemistry as best undergraduate chemistry program in the nation by the Higher Education Research Institute, the addition of two endowed chairs in the Humanities and Social Sciences department, the growth of the endowment from $5 million to $50 million, and the graduation of the College's 2,000th graduate.
