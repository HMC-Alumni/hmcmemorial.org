The Harvey Mudd College community was saddened to learn of the death this week of Professor Emeritus of Political Science Nathaniel Davis.

Davis joined the ranks of the HMC faculty as the first Alexander and Adelaide Hixon Professor of Humanities in 1983, after a distinguished career in the Foreign Service. He held posts in Czechoslovakia, Italy and the Soviet Union, and served as a U.S. ambassador to several countries including Guatemala, Chile and Switzerland 

“Nat brought spectacular insight into world politics to HMC and shared this with students in his classes,” said Dean of Faculty Bob Cave “His classes were highly sought after by students and they benefited both from his knowledge and kindness.  In faculty meetings he was particularly adept at seeing the heart of an issue and offering wise counsel. He retired from the faculty in 2002. He continued to attend campus events and had a wonderful way of encouraging those whom he met—he will be missed.”
