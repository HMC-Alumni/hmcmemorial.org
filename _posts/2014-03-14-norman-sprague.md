Harvey Mudd College Trustee Norman F. Sprague III, an active and dedicated member of the board of trustees for 35 years, died March 14, 2014, at the age of 67. He was the grandson of Harvey S. Mudd, for whom the College is named.

“Norm was a truly extraordinary person as well as an amazing supporter of Harvey Mudd College,” said President Maria Klawe. “We will miss him dearly.”

Sprague was the son of Caryll Mudd Sprague and Norman Sprague Jr., a founding trustee of the College. Sprague carried on the family tradition of deep involvement with the College, joining the board in 1979. He served for many years as chair of the Investment Committee, supporting the College through financial guidance and his own philanthropy. Sprague donated generously to Harvey Mudd to fund multiple student scholarships, as well as the construction of the Hoch-Shanahan Dining Commons and Shanahan Center for Teaching and Learning.
