Louise Bell, a devoted supporter of Harvey Mudd College and wife of the late emeritus physics faculty member Graydon Bell, died August 16, 2018.

“Louise Bell and her husband, Gray, opened their home and their lives to generations of HMC students and newer faculty members (Since Gray Bell was the founding member of the HMC physics department, just about all faculty members were newer than them!),” said Theresa Lynn, chair of the physics department.  “Many faculty members and alumni have fond memories of games, food and laughter at the house of the Bells. Louise was also influential across the 5C community, notably in helping to establish International Place as a resource for international students.”

The Bells will be long remembered by the College community and the Department of Physics for their named fund, The Graydon and Louise Bell Endowed Prize, created in their honor in 1999. It is awarded at the start of the fall semester to a senior physics major for outstanding scholarship, creativity and service.
