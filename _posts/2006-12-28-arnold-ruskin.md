Arnold M. Ruskin, professor of engineering at Harvey Mudd College from 1963 to 1973, died on December 28, 2006.

On Sunday, Jan. 21, 2007, a memorial was held for Ruskin in the Green Room located in the Joseph B. Platt Campus Center on the Harvey Mudd College (HMC) campus.

Ruskin joined HMC when it was a fledging new college of engineering, science and mathematics. He made many significant contributions that helped define the character of the college.

Ruskin developed the basis for the materials engineering course, which is now part of the core program for all engineering students. He was a significant early contributor to the innovative engineering Clinic Program, which proved to be a landmark in experiential engineering and has now been emulated by hundreds of colleges and universities in the U.S. and abroad. He recruited a significant number of the initial Clinic projects that were funded by companies which paved the way for the current Clinic model used at HMC.

Achieving tenure and becoming a full professor of engineering and the Union Oil Fellow in Engineering, Ruskin established himself as a formidable scholar. During Ruskin's career at HMC, the engineering department was dynamically engaged in designing its future. He served as an industrious faculty member who participated in key committees that helped pioneer and solidify the foundation that would establish the college into national prominence.

Ruskin made an unforgettable impression at HMC and is remembered favorably by HMC community members, such as Oliver C. Field Professor of Engineering Donald Remer who stated, “Arnie Ruskin was the most energetic, hard working, conscientious individual that I have ever known. We worked together professionally for over 30 years. I will really miss his sage advice.”

Ruskin left HMC to accept a position as engineering manager at Everett/Charles Inc. He then became the vice president and program manager of the Claremont Engineering Company. Subsequently, Ruskin co-founded the Claremont Consulting Group, which has become a highly acclaimed organization in training, coaching and consulting for Fortune 500 companies as well as small entrepreneurial enterprises, government agencies and national research and development laboratories.

Author of two books, What Every Engineer Should Know About Project Management, coauthored with W.E. Estes (which is now in its third edition) and Materials Considerations in Design, Ruskin also published over 35 papers on engineering, project management and technical management. He held one patent and was a member of the editorial board and book review editor of Engineering Management International and a member of the editorial board of Engineering Management Journal.

Ruskin was profiled in Who's Who in Technology Today, Who's Who in Finance and Industry, American Men and Women of Science, Who's Who in the West, and Who's Who in California.

Ruskin is survived by his wife, Nancy, his daughter and son-in-law, Sandra and James Reilly, M.D. and grandson, Timothy Maxwell all living in the county of Los Angeles, California; and a sister, Rae Ruskin, living in Michigan.
