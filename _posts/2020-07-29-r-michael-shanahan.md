R. Michael “Mike” Shanahan, a profoundly influential person in the life of Harvey Mudd College for over 25 years, passed away July 29 after a long battle with Alzheimer’s disease.

A native of Altadena, California, Mike was a graduate of Stanford University and a U.S. Navy veteran. Upon completing his studies, he joined Capital Group, a Los Angeles-based asset management firm, as an investment analyst and built a 47-year career there. Shanahan is viewed as one of the principal architects of Capital, an organization that is among the world’s leading financial services providers. In 1968, he became the firm’s youngest-ever director of research and went on to hold several prominent leadership roles. He was also a formidable investor, serving as a portfolio manager for The Investment Company of America and AMCAP mutual funds during periods of unparalleled growth. He retired from Capital in December 2012.

In addition to his leadership at Capital, Shanahan made a huge impact at Harvey Mudd College. As a trustee, he was influential in building important relationships for the College throughout his tenure. He served as the fifth chair of the HMC Board of Trustees and chair of the Investment Committee, and provided vital contributions to the Compensation and Personnel Policy Committee as well as the Board Affairs, Advancement, Student Affairs and Educational Planning committees. In 2008, Mike and Mary Shanahan pledged $25 million to HMC, the College’s largest single gift at the time.

In a letter to the campus upon his death, President Maria Klawe wrote, “I feel very lucky to have had the opportunity to know Mike and to benefit from his wisdom, warmth and generosity. His passing is a huge loss.” “He just really fell in love with the attention that the College paid to undergraduate education and the quality of the undergraduate education there,” said Jim Bean ’77, current chair of the board of trustees. “His gifts touched every aspect of the College—faculty, students, staff, buildings—everything.” Shanahan was awarded Harvey Mudd’s honorary Doctor of Engineering, Science and Humane Letters degree in 2012 for his distinguished contributions to the advancement of science and engineering education, a Lifetime Recognition Award in 2009, and the Order of the Wart from the Harvey Mudd College Alumni Association in 2004. He also received the College’s Sprague Award for Outstanding Volunteer Service in 2006.

Predeceased by his wife, Mary, Mike is survived by his three children, Kathleen Shanahan Fisher, Robert M. Shanahan Jr. and Keven Shanahan, six grandchildren, brother Tom Shanahan, as well as Cathy Shanahan, his first wife and the mother of his three children.

Individuals wishing to honor Shanahan may make donations to The Alzheimer’s Association.
