Kitty Ressler ’75 (math) passed away on July 9, after a courageous battle with early onset dementia while being supported by her family and many friends.

After Harvey Mudd, she accepted an engineering position in Washington, D.C. with the Naval Electronics Systems Command, where she helped set up and manage Navy communications stations around the world. She returned to California in the early ’80s, joining GTE Government Systems, Mountain View, as a project engineer, ultimately rising to become the director of Intelligence Warfare Systems. She departed GTE in 1997 and joined the startup company Snap Track Inc. developing the E-911 mobile cellular handset GPS location system used by most cellular companies worldwide. Snap Track was purchased by Qualcomm in 2000. At her retirement from Qualcomm in 2007, Kitty was concurrently the CEO of the independent Snap Track division and a Qualcomm vice president.

In retirement, she followed her lifetime love of animals by joining the board of directors of the North County Humane Society as the organization treasurer and continued in that capacity until NCHS merged with Woods Humane Society in 2017.
