The founding member and former chair of the Department of Biology at Harvey Mudd College William K. Purves, passed away April 22 in Costa Mesa with family at his side.

Purves was the Stuart Mudd Professor of Biology from 1977 to 1995. He served as chair of the department of computer science from 1985 to 1990 and of the department of biology from 1985 to 1995.

He elected early retirement in 1995 after teaching introductory biology for 34 consecutive years in order to concentrate entirely on research directed at learning and scientific education. The move grew from his association with Roger Schank, first in his Artificial Intelligence Group at Yale, then in his Institute for the Learning Sciences at Northwestern University, and in his activities at Carnegie-Mellon University, Engines for Education, Socratic Arts, and Grandview School. Purves participated in the development of Schankâ€™s Virtual International Science and Technology Academy.
