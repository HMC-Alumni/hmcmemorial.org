The Harvey Mudd College community mourns the loss of physicist, historian and Harvey Mudd alumnus Richard G. Olson, who died June 27. Former chair of the faculty and chair of the Department of Humanities, Social Sciences, and the Arts, Olson was a prolific writer with more than 60 published works in the history of science. He served on the Harvey Mudd faculty for 35 years before his retirement in 2011.

Born in Saint Paul, Minnesota, Olson grew up in South Dakota, expecting to be a cabinet maker. No one in his family had pursued a college education, and he hadn’t considered it. While he was in high school, his father was transferred to Walnut Creek, California, and the family relocated. Olson tried to get summer work on a construction site, wasn’t hired, and decided that if he couldn’t build small things, he’d build big ones: he’d become an engineer.
