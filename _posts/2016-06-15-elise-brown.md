Accomplished physician, patient advocate and mentor Elise Brown ’95 (biology) is being remembered by her classmates, family and friends with an endowed scholarship, established in April.

Brown, who passed away from complications of a bleeding cerebral aneurysm in June 2016, was an integral part of the strong, tough, supportive and fantastic women of the Harvey Mudd Class of 1995. She went on to earn a master’s in public health at San Diego State University followed by an M.D. from Jefferson Medical College of Thomas Jefferson University.

As a physician, she was recognized as a champion for advocating for her patients, often going above and beyond to ensure they received the best care possible and tending to the needs of families during critical times. Her peers remember Brown as an astute clinician known for her dedication to medical education and for sharing her knowledge with nurses, medical students and fellow colleagues.

“Elise embodied the values that Harvey Mudd holds dear—a commitment to making the world a better place—through her continual pursuit of knowledge and her compassion for her patients, her peers and her loved ones,” says Elizabeth Orwin ’95, now a Harvey Mudd professor and chair of the Department of Engineering.

In tribute to Elise, several of her Mudd classmates rallied to raise funds to establish the endowed Elise C. Brown ’95 Memorial Scholarship. Along with family and friends, they were able to contribute $63,450 to fund the scholarship, exceeding the original goal of $50,000.

Beginning in fall 2017, the Elise C. Brown ’95 Memorial Endowed Scholarship will annually support a Harvey Mudd student, preferably female, who intends to pursue a career in medicine.

“We believe that the wonderful outpouring of support and successful fundraising for this scholarship in such a short time gives further evidence of the truly special impact Elise had on each and every one of us, whether as a classmate, patient, friend, family member or loved one. And we all know that she touched the lives of so many others, as well, during her too-brief life,” says Steven Hubbell ’95. “It is with gratefulness that we can take comfort knowing that through this scholarship, her life and memory will continue to inspire, serve and help give bright futures to the next generation.”
