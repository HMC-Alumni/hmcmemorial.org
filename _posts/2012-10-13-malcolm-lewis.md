Malcolm Lewis ’67, internationally recognized expert in the design of energy-efficient buildings and past chair of the board of trustees of Harvey Mudd College, died Saturday October 13, 2012 at the age of 66.

Lewis became the first alumnus elected to the HMC board of trustees in 1973 and served on the board continuously for the next 39 years. In January 2012, he was elected chair of the board, the first alumnus to serve in this position.

“Having had the opportunity to know and serve on the board with many of the founding trustees, I feel like I carry a bit of their founding spirit,” Lewis said at the start of his term as chair. “Their commitment to taking risks to improve STEM education is one that I believe we want to always nurture–not settling for what is working, but challenging ourselves to evolve with the times to become even better at what we do.”

Lewis founded Constructive Technologies Group, Inc. (CTG), a consulting firm that provides support to building owners and designers to optimize the performance of new and existing buildings. Through his consulting work, Lewis educated architects, engineers, building owners, city planners and utility workers about sustainability, building comfort and building efficiency.

Well known for his expertise in the design of sustainable buildings, Lewis was active in the development of the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) green building rating system. He served as a board member of the U.S. Green Building Council from 1997 to 2002, as chairman of the (LEED) Technical and Scientific Advisory Committee from 2001 to 2009, and as chairman of the LEED Technical Committee. In 2011, Lewis was named a LEED Fellow in the inaugural class of fellows. He oversaw more than 150 LEED-certified projects, and developed and delivered online training on energy efficiency and sustainability for multiple clients.
