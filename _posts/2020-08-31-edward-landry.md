Edward A. Landry passed away on Aug. 31. Upon graduation from law school, he joined the law firm of Musick Peeler & Garrett in Los Angeles, where he practiced for 55 years, handling the estates of many prominent Californians, including that of J. Paul Getty. Landry was an active member of numerous civic/charitable organizations. He became associated with Harvey Mudd College in the 1960s, was a trustee from 1982–2012 and an emeritus trustee since 2012.

As an active trustee, Landry will be remembered for his quiet, gentle and insightful presence. He served on many of the board’s standing committees, introduced the College to prominent foundations and was a longtime supporter of HMC scholarships. Among his passions was architecture; the Landry home was the cover story of the spring [2005 HMC Bulletin](https://bit.ly/landry-hmcmagspr05). Landry is survived by his wife of 58 years, Madeleine Landry; two daughters Monique Jenson, and Lucette Landry, three grandchildren and siblings.
