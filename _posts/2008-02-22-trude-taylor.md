Harvey Mudd College Trustee Trude C. Taylor, whose service to the college spanned five decades, died Feb. 22 at the age of 86.

Taylor was introduced to the college by Henry T. Mudd, the son of the college’s namesake Harvey S. Mudd. Taylor began his tenure as a trustee in 1969.

As a member of HMC’s board, Taylor chaired the Founding Friends, presidential search, development planning and educational planning committees. He was also a member of the board’s corporations, board affairs, investment, and compensation and personnel policy committees.

He was co-chair with trustee Walter Foley ‘69 of the 1989-94 Campaign for Harvey Mudd College, HMC’s last comprehensive fund-raising campaign, which raised $75.5 million. In addition to scholarship and other program support, the campaign funded the creation of the departments of biology and computer science; the construction of the F.W. Olin Science Center, Arnold and Mabel Beckman Hall, Ronald and Maxine Linde Residence Hall, a new wing of the Parsons Engineering Building; and the renovation of the Jacobs Science Center.

“As we mourn Trude’s passing, we should take the opportunity to celebrate his remarkable service to Harvey Mudd College,” said William A. Mingst, chair of the board of trustees. “His dedication to the college and its mission was steadfast, and an example for all trustees to emulate.”

Harvey Mudd College president Maria Klawe said, “Trude Taylor could always be counted upon to have the best interest of the college and its students at the forefront of any discussion. We enjoyed many spirited conversations about the direction of the college and he was adamant that our students should be afforded nothing short of the finest learning experience possible.”

Taylor was the eighth person to receive an honorary degree from the college when it was bestowed on him in 2002. He was also made an honorary alumnus of the college in 1994 and awarded the Alumni Lifetime Recognition Award in 2006.

During the Campaign for Harvey Mudd College, Taylor said, “HMC is a unique college with an innovative curriculum and dedicated faculty teaching students of very high potential to become leaders in science and engineering. I get tremendous satisfaction from seeing these fine young people grow into mature adults ready for work or further academic training.”

Taylor was the retired chairman of Electronic Memories and Magnetics Corporation, and he served as a director of several privately held high-technology companies in California. He received a B.S. in mechanical engineering from UCLA in 1949 and an MBA from Harvard in 1951. A private pilot, Taylor was interested in furniture making, computer science, flying and big band music.
