Ben will be remembered as a campus leader. He shared the presidency of the Class of 2014 with Jack Ma ’14 for both their freshman and sophomore years.

In the coming year, he was to have been both a mentor and a dorm president for Sontag. He served on the Advisory Board for the teaching and learning building and was a co-founder of DrySHMC.

He was also a member of The Claremont Braineaters, the 5-C Men’s Ultimate Frisbee team. Ben’s heart, intelligence, patience and good judgment made him a treasured friend and a valuable colleague. All of us who knew and worked with Ben will miss him deeply.
