During his tenure, he served on the Student Affairs, Board Affairs, Development and Educational Planning committees.

He also helped a number of students gain admission to his alma mater, the USC School of Dentistry.

Boone graduated with a B.S. and a D.D.S. in dentistry and an M.S. in orthodontics from the USC School of Dentistry. He practiced orthodontics in the Pasadena area before becoming chairman of Boone/Fetter Associates Inc., a private real estate investment firm in Monrovia, Calif., and president of The Boone Foundation.

Boone was a life trustee of the University of Southern California and former president of the USC General Alumni Association; a life trustee of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and a trustee emeritus of the California Institute of the Arts, where he funded the Interschool Fund for Artistic Advancement. A collector of contemporary sculpture as well as medieval and Renaissance art, Boone was co-chairperson for the Huntington Library's 75th Anniversary in 1994.

Boone is survived by his wife, MaryLou, three children, great-grandchildren and sister, Jeanne Boone Tappan.
