The Harvey Mudd College community mourns the passing of Earnest Hubert “E.H.” Clark Jr., who died on April 24. Clark actively served on the Harvey Mudd College Board of Trustees from 1971 until his appointment to emeritus trustee in 2008, providing support and wise counsel to all five of Harvey Mudd College’s presidents.

Known to friends and associates as “Hubie,” Clark served as the third chair of the board of Harvey Mudd College from 1981 to 1988. His first question upon accepting the chairmanship was, “What do we need to do to make the College better?” The next seven years were spent addressing that question, and the College thrived under his leadership. During Clark’s time as chair, the board helped steer the College as it launched a capital campaign and significantly increased the endowment, added the biology major, constructed two residence halls (J.L. Atwood and Case) and acquired land. Before leading the board, Clark chaired the Academic Planning and Student Affairs committees and was an HMC Founding Friend.

Clark, a graduate of Caltech, was attracted to working with Harvey Mudd College because he believed in the importance of education beyond the diploma; more specifically, he praised the College’s unique hands-on engineering program. While on the board, Clark was instrumental in facilitating relationships with industry, including the relationship between Harvey Mudd College and the R.C. Baker Foundation.

Clark’s generous financial contributions to the College include funding for the R.C. Baker Foundation Annual Scholarship, the Hubie and Patty Clark Annual Scholarship, the Hubie and Patty Clark Summer Research Fellowship, funds for a building addition to the Parsons Engineering Building, and a machine shop renovation grant. In honor of Clark’s longtime dedication to the College, fellow trustee emeritus Carl Robertson established the E.H. Clark Jr. Endowed Scholarship for Academic Excellence and Leadership, a scholarship awarded to one or more students in their junior or senior year who excel academically in addition to serving as outstanding campus leaders.

In 2006, Clark became just the ninth person in HMC history to be awarded an honorary doctor of engineering degree. For his extraordinary service to Harvey Mudd, he also received the College’s Lifetime Recognition Award.
