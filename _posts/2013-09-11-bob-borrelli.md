Robert “Bob” L. Borrelli, a longtime faculty member, campus leader and friend of Harvey Mudd College died Sept. 11, 2013 at the age of 81, following a short period of declining health. Borrelli joined the faculty in 1964, taught for 35 years and was active at Harvey Mudd in his retirement, influencing the College’s development in many ways.

“In addition to being an inspiring teacher and colleague, Bob was a driving force in the mathematics field, especially at Harvey Mudd,” said President Maria Klawe. “This is splendidly shown in the 2006 Award for an Exemplary Mathematics Program from the American Mathematical Society, the first such award ever given.”
