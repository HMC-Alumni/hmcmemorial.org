An honored guest at a mathematics conference in Iran? A passion for the sport of curling? A lover of dogs and small children? While many of us thought we knew Mel Henriksen, professor of mathematics emeritus at Harvey Mudd College, this softer side of Mel was revealed when his long and productive career was commemorated by the Claremont Mathematics community, an assortment of prominent mathematicians, and members of Mel’s family at a one day conference on Saturday, March 27th.

Mel passed away on October 14, 2009 at the age of 82 and spent a significant portion of his life at Harvey Mudd College where he served as a professor of mathematics from 1969 to 1997. After Mel retired, he remained an active member of the mathematics community in Claremont and beyond. Henriksen was well known in the mathematics community for his work on the study of rings of continuous functions, which involves the interplay of algebra and topology.

Jezmyne Dene, the Claremont Science Librarian who perhaps knew Mel best in his last few years compiled a set of Mel memorabilia, including copies of Mel’s papers (he authored over a hundred publications) and the single variable calculus text that he wrote. Mel's published papers spanned over half a century, starting in the early 1950s and continuing through this past year.
