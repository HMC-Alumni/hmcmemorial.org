Harvey Mudd College engineering Professor Emeritus Harry E. Williams Jr. passed away suddenly at Pomona Valley Hospital on Sept. 23 from complications following a stroke.

Williams joined Harvey Mudd in 1960 as a professor of physics, pending an opening in the Department of Engineering. A year later, he moved to engineering where, for the next 40 years, he taught courses from fluid and solid mechanics to thermodynamics and more, helping to build the department from its infancy.
