All are welcome to attend a memorial for Professor Emeritus Theodore Waldman, which will be held on the Harvey Mudd College campus on Sunday, Feb. 19, at 2 p.m. in the Green Room of Platt Campus Center.

The Harvey Mudd College Community was saddened to hear that Ted Waldman, who was a professor in the Department of Humanities and Social Sciences for 28 years, died on December 8, 2005, following surgery.

Jeff Groves, chair of the Humanities and Social Sciences Department at HMC remarked, "The College was greatly enriched and many student lives were touched by Ted's absolute commitment to our educational mission."

Waldman graduated from Washington University in St. Louis in 1947 with a bachelor of arts in philosophy. He earned his master's in philosophy in 1948, master's in sociology in 1951 and his Ph.D. in philosophy in 1956 from U.C. Berkeley.
