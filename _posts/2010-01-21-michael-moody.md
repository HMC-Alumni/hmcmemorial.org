Michael Moody, cherished friend, mentor and inspiration to the members of the Harvey Mudd College (HMC) Math Department, passed away  January 21 after a long and difficult battle with lymphoma.

Moody, former professor of mathematics and chair of the Department of Mathematics at HMC, came to the college in 1994 as a visiting professor of mathematics from Washington State University, where he was an associate professor of mathematics. In 1996, he became HMC’s first Diana and Kenneth Jonsson Professor and, that same year, was named chair of the Department of Mathematics.

From 1996 until 2002, the department hired eight new professors; the total number of faculty was then 12. Moody wanted people who would mesmerize and inspire students in the classroom and have a passion for their mathematical work.  Moody set for the department what he called an “animating goal”: To be recognized as one the very best undergraduate programs in the country.
