Henry E. (“Hank”) Riggs, past president of Harvey Mudd College, former vice president for development at Stanford University, founder and first president of Keck Graduate Institute, died at his home in Palo Alto on June 10, after a brief illness. His wife and children were at his side. A memorial service is planned for June 23 at 2:30 p.m. in the Arrillaga Alumni Center on the Stanford campus.

Riggs had a remarkable career as entrepreneur, professor, writer, and leader in higher education. He continually sought out challenges and his vision fundamentally shaped every institution with which he was involved. Throughout his life, his abiding passion was for teaching, and he taught up until a few weeks before his death. He will be remembered for his immense talent, enduring vision, uncompromising integrity and enormous generosity.
