James Andrew “Andy” Wehrenberg ’72 died on Oct. 13. After receiving a bachelor’s in physics from HMC, he did his graduate work in nuclear engineering at the University of Washington. He worked in the design of the initial construction of nuclear power plants in Madrid, Spain and Augusta, Georgia, for Bechtel Corp. He also worked for Southern Company Services as a consulting engineer.

In retirement, he enjoyed playing bridge, working on home projects, reading all genres, listening to classic rock, spending time with family and friends, traveling, keeping the Cahaba River clean and “discussing” politics. He volunteered to help seniors do their taxes through AARP. Memorial contributions can be made to the Flick and Jack Wehrenberg Scholarship, an endowed scholarship that Andy established at HMC in honor of his parents to support a deserving student who has demonstrated financial need each year.
