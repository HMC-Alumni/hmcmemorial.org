Stavros Busenberg, 51, respected mathematical researcher and professor of mathematics at [Harvey Mudd College](https://www.hmc.edu/) and the [Claremont Graduate School](https://www.cgu.edu/). A native of [Jerusalem](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Jerusalem,+Israel/@31.7964453,35.1053191,12z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x1502d7d634c1fc4b:0xd96f623e456ee1cb!8m2!3d31.768319!4d35.21371), Busenberg immigrated to the United States with his family as a teen-ager and studied at [Cooper Union](http://cooper.edu) in New York City and at the [Illinois Institute of Technology](https://www.iit.edu/). At Claremont for more than 20 years, he directed several mathematics clinics devoted to applied research for such companies as [Hughes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hughes_Aircraft_Company). Busenberg wrote more than 75 research papers and five books, including one published in January, "Vertically Transmitted Diseases: Models and Dynamics." Among his specialties were mathematical theories that model the spread of disease in human populations. On April 3 in Claremont of [amyotrophic lateral sclerosis](https://www.als.org/understanding-als/what-is-als), or Lou Gehrig's disease.

His [full obituary](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1993-04-21-me-25232-story.html) is available in the Los Angeles Times.

A year later, 200 colleagues collaborators and friends joined in a four day international conference at Harvey Mudd College on mathematics, mathematical biology and other topics of interest to Stavros. You can read the memorial [here](https://scholarship.claremont.edu/hmnj/vol1/iss11/4/).
