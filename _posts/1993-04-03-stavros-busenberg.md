Stavros Busenberg, 51, respected mathematical researcher and professor of mathematics at Harvey Mudd College and the Claremont Graduate School. A native of Jerusalem, Busenberg immigrated to the United States with his family as a teen-ager and studied at Cooper Union in New York City and at the Illinois Institute of Technology. At Claremont for more than 20 years, he directed several mathematics clinics devoted to applied research for such companies as Hughes. Busenberg wrote more than 75 research papers and five books, including one published in January, "Vertically Transmitted Diseases: Models and Dynamics." Among his specialties were mathematical theories that model the spread of disease in human populations. On April 3 in Claremont of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or Lou Gehrig's disease.
