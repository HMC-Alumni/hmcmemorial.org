The Harvey Mudd College community mourns the passing of Jack Holmes Waggoner, a longtime physics professor and emeritus faculty member at Harvey Mudd College. He died Saturday, July 2.

Waggoner was born in 1929 and was a native of Ohio. He completed his B.S. (1949) and PhD at Ohio State University (1957). He taught from 1959 to 1961 at the University of California, Riverside, and then was hired to join the Harvey Mudd College faculty as an assistant professor of physics in 1961. Upon receiving tenure and promotion in 1965, Waggoner wrote to President Joe Platt that “Working at the College has been both a pleasure and an inspiration—I do indeed look forward to growing with it.”
