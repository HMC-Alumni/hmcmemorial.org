Harvey Mudd College was saddened to learn of the death last week of generous supporter Leonore Annenberg, widow of philanthropist and publisher Walter Annenberg and grandmother of HMC trustee Howard C. Deshong III '89. She died of natural causes at Eisenhower Medical Center in Rancho Mirage, Calif., at age 91. Family members, including Deshong, were at her side when she passed.

Leonore Annenberg—known to her friends and family as “Lee”— continued her late husband's tradition of philanthropy and patronage of the arts.  After Walter’s death in October 2002, she served as president and chairman of the Annenberg Foundation, whose mission is to advance the public well-being through improved communication. In its 2005 15th anniversary report, "Creating Opportunities: Fifteen Years of Advancing the Public Good," the foundation reported awarding some 5,200 grants totaling more than $2.8 billion.

Leonore Annenberg and the Annenberg Foundation were generous contributors to the growth and success of Harvey Mudd College over the years. In 2006, the foundation gave $2 million to establish the Walter and Leonore Annenberg Fund for Leadership Development. The endowed fund supports a visiting professorship in leadership and management and programs in leadership development for HMC students. Most recently, former mayor of Los Angeles Richard J. Riordan visited campus as an Annenberg visiting professor. Upcoming speakers in the 2009 lecture series include Irwin Mark Jacobs, co-founder of Qualcomm, Inc.

Leonore Annenberg was born in New York City and graduated from Stanford University. As a patron of the fine arts, she was a member of the board of trustees of the Philadelphia Museum of Art and a member of the acquisitions committee of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. She also served on the Trustee's Council of The National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., and was recently inducted as a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Leonore Annenberg was named U.S. chief of protocol, a position that carries the rank of ambassador, during President Ronald Reagan's first term. Her husband Walter served as ambassador to Britain for President Richard Nixon a decade earlier.

In 2001, she was awarded the Andrew Carnegie Medal of Philanthropy. Upon receipt of this honor, she is quoted as saying: “Walter and I believe that education is the foundation of a democratic society. When asked what motivates his philanthropic work, my husband has responded with a very powerful statement: 'I regard my philanthropic work as an investment in the future of America. It is the most effective way I can serve my country and help to ensure its benefits for the next generation.'”

Leonore Annenberg is survived by a sister, two daughters, one stepdaughter, seven grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren. Her complete biography, which lists her numerous awards, affiliations and achievements can be found at the Annenberg Foundation website. An extensive obituary is also available at the Los Angeles Times.
