Joseph B. Platt, founding president of Harvey Mudd College, died at home in Claremont on Tuesday, July 10, 2012. He was 96.  An accomplished physicist, Platt took the helm as HMCâ€™s founding president in 1956 and led the College through two decades of growth to national acclaim as a premiere engineering, math and science college.

After stepping down from Harvey Mudd College, Platt served from 1976 to 1981 as eighth president of Claremont Graduate School and University Center (now Claremont Graduate University). He returned to HMC in 1981 as senior professor of physics where he taught well into his 90s.

Platt died peacefully at home after a period of declining health, said daughter Ann Platt Walker.
