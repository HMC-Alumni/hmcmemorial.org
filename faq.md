## Who runs this website?

Chris Alef '96 and any members of the [HMC Alumni](https://github.com/HMC-Alumni) organization that care to help out.

## How did this site come about?

In 2021, the class of 1996 was preparing for their 25th reunion. They wanted to remember the faculty and classmates that could not participate in the reunion, so they started collecting together stories for a memorial presentation. We shortly discovered that other classes had done the same thing, yet there wasn't a great way to share stories across classes.

## Where do you get all the information for the entries?

Alumni have found the information scattered across <a href="https://www.hmc.edu/">hmc.edu</a> and the rest of the web.

* [Harvey Mudd College Alumni Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/31177940784)
* Bryan Marten '90 shared [1990 Faculty In Memoriam](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1iCJc7f0agb7NUpTJg4JUeckrBRT1XJ5hwsj-xRV3zCY/edit#slide=id.g7adf87da09_0_153), which in turn was sourced from:
  * [In Memoriam News](https://www.hmc.edu/about-hmc/category/in-memoriam/)
  * [Harvey Mudd Remembers](https://www.hmc.edu/in-memoriam/)
  * [Old HMC News](https://www.hmc.edu/non-wp-sites/old-news/)
